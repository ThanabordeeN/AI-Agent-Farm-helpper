# AI Agent Crew for Farmers

## Overview
This project leverages the capabilities of local large language models (LLMs) and LangChain to develop AI agents tailored for assisting farmers. These agents are designed to address specific agricultural challenges, providing farmers with data-driven insights and recommendations.

## Features
- **Targeted Research:** Utilizes tools like DuckDuckGo for precise information retrieval.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Empowers farmers with the latest scientific knowledge to make well-informed decisions.

## Components

### LLMs (Local Deployment with Ollama)
- **Models Used:** Specify the LLMs, such as those from Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Privacy and Offline Use:** Ollama supports local deployment of LLMs, ensuring data privacy and enabling potential offline usage.

### LangChain
- **Agent Architecture:** LangChain's architecture promotes flexible problem-solving capabilities.
- **Modules:** Key modules include chains, memory, and tools, which will be integral to the functionality of the AI agents.

### CrewAI
- **Orchestration:** CrewAI plays a pivotal role in coordinating the AI agents and enhancing their collaborative efforts.

### DuckDuckGo
- **Targeted Searches:** DuckDuckGo provides the agents with the ability to conduct targeted searches for agricultural information.
