# AI Agent Crew for Farmers
### Experimental project
## Overview
This project leverages the capabilities of local large language models (LLMs) and LangChain to develop AI agents tailored for assisting farmers. These agents are designed to address specific agricultural challenges, providing farmers with data-driven insights and recommendations.

## Features
- **Targeted Research:** Utilizes tools like DuckDuckGo for precise information retrieval.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Empowers farmers with the latest scientific knowledge to make well-informed decisions.

## Components

### LLMs (Local Deployment with Ollama)
- **Models Used:** We employ the Mistral model, known for its efficiency and adaptability in various language tasks.
- **Ollama Deployment:** Ollama is utilized for the local deployment of Mistral, ensuring data privacy and enabling potential offline usage. This setup allows for quick iterations and real-time model updates without compromising sensitive information.

### LangChain
- **Agent Architecture:** LangChain's architecture is designed to support flexible problem-solving, allowing AI agents to adapt to a wide range of agricultural scenarios.
- **Modules:** We leverage key LangChain modules such as chains, memory, and tools, which are crucial for the AI agents' functionality and decision-making processes.

### CrewAI
- **Orchestration:** CrewAI orchestrates the AI agents, ensuring seamless collaboration and efficient task distribution among the agents.

### DuckDuckGo
- **Targeted Searches:** DuckDuckGo is integrated to enable precise and relevant searches, providing the agents with up-to-date agricultural information.
